### Practice testing React Components
Using jest and react-testing-library

#### smoke tests
use render methods from @testing-library/reactx
to check wether a component can be rendered or crashes.

####  snapshot tests
take snapshots and compare subsequent renders with the snapshots

####  user interaction tests
Testing actual events and desired change in output.
Render -> find elements -> fire an event -> check changes
